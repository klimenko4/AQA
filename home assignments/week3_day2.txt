1) Complete all the previous assignments;
2) Create negative/positive(already registered,new user,wrong email format) tests for a registration of a new user on hotline.ua website.
3) Use TestNG framework to run and configure tests. 
4) Use the dataprovides to run registration tests with negative/positive test data.
5) Group the registration tests into "registration" group and configure the testng suite xml to run only this group out of all the tests.
e.g :
  - SearchAndFilterProductsTest.java
  - RegistrationAndSignInTest.java 
  create a test section in  the testng suite xml to include both test classes but apply the filter on groups to run only "registration" test.
